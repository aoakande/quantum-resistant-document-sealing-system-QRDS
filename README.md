## 🔒 Project Overview
QRDS is a future-proof document verification system built on the Stacks blockchain that combines post-quantum cryptography with blockchain technology to provide long-term document integrity verification. As quantum computing advances threaten traditional cryptographic methods, QRDS ensures documents sealed today remain secure in a post-quantum world.

### 🎯 Key Features
- Post-quantum cryptographic document sealing
- Merkle signature scheme implementation
- Real-time document verification
- Immutable audit trail
- Document metadata management
- Ownership verification and transfer capabilities

## 🌟 Why Stacks?
QRDS leverages Stacks' unique capabilities:
- Bitcoin's security for permanent document sealing
- Clarity smart contracts for transparent verification logic
- Stacks 2.1's increased throughput for efficient document processing
- Bitcoin's settlement assurance for critical documents

## 🔧 Technical Architecture
1. **Smart Contracts**
   - Document sealing contract
   - Ownership management contract
   - Verification logic contract

2. **Quantum-Resistant Components**
